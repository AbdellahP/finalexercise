HI.........

Welcome to my Hub & Spoke project. 

Hope it's good enough :)

### Instructions 

In order to run the ps1 file you should first connect to azure. In order to avoid any hiccups on deployment I suggest to run connect-AzAccount twice and give it a few seconds before running the .ps1 file. 

Once the file is run please allow some time for the file to deploy.

If encounter a error on deployment most of the time this is due the sandbox. Close powershell terminal ->  sign out sandbox -> create new sandbox ->  sign in to portal and repeat the process above to run the ps1 file.
